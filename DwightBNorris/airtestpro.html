                    Air Test Pro provides visitors with a place to not only find answers to their problems, but to also
                    show why these solutions work through testing. The air purification market is widely unregulated and
                    testing is under the scrutiny of the only the manufacturer. Air Test Pro provides live testing within
                    real environments to give visitors what they truly need "Results".

                <p>
                    Air Test Pro is my personal online business that I am growing. I provided detailed air testing data that
                    is used to decipher what the best way is to clean your home. Unlike all the people that have allergies like
                    myself, I have found many people with a variety of health issues like COPD and lung disease that need this
                    information. These visitors don't know what to make of arbitrary data. I am telling and showing them how I
                    test and how I compute the data into information that provides a solution for them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am not just a person creating an informational product. I have severe allergies that I have dealth with 
                    since birth. I know how important it is for people to get quality help through information and that is why
                    I decided to make this website. Finding the best solution for each individual person is very hard and I want
                    to make that process easier.

                <h3 class="textBlack">My Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Before I made this website I owned "www.best-air-purifiers-reviews.com", which I did a pretty poor job on for
                    3 years. It was basic HTML and CSS with no thrills. Now that I am learning new skills, I will be implementing
                    and re-implementing new technologies (Javascript + MEAN Stack). I decided to start off using HTML, CSS and 
                    Bootstrap to make basis of my website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I spent most of my time working on a single web application for the website. It is located on the bottom of the
                    homepage. In theory it is simple, I provide the visitor with a set of questions and when they select one they are 
                    sent to another list of questions that build upon the first question. I started off trying a switch statement,
                    but it didn't work as well as I would like. I decided to do this using a more elegant solution using Javascript.
                    I structured my Javascript file in "Levels". Each level has the variety of questions and/or answers for that level.
                </p>

                <p id="marginTop2">
                    The real heart of the web app is the output options available at certain steps. You could reach a final step that
                    would give you text information, a picture a product with a buy now link or a link for one of my personal products.
                    The information I provide in this web app is free and it allows the visitors to get a good idea of where their issues
                    occur and how they can solve them. I will also be presenting this web app to my Harvard CS50 (C Programming) course
                    in a 2 minute video. It will be my final project for the class.

                    Currently, my website is still in early development. I will be spending a lot of time creating content along with increasing
                    my web development skills.
