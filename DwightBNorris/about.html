                                        My programming journey started at James Madison University (JMU) in 1999 when I signed
                                        up for Computer Science as a major. I was accepted after taking two strenous JAVA courses.
                                        The dean of Computer Science stated they would allow me to join, but they believed
                                        my scholarship in Track and Field would not allow me the time to excel in my studies.
                                        I unfortunately took that advice and switched to Technical Writing. I discovered web
                                        development here and created websites for a JMU scholarship program using HTML, CSS,
                                        Flash and Dreamweaver. While pursuing my Master's of Science, I took a networking
                                        and cryptography class.
                                    </p>

                                        I created a computer hardware review website in 2006 to start an online business. I
                                        realized that my competition had a lot more tools, people and time than myself so
                                        I shut down the website. In August 2015, I realized my dream of completing
                                        a MIT course (<b>
                                            MIT 6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using

                                        </b>). At the same time, I completed the University of Michigan's course
                                        (<b>U. Michigan: Programming for Everybody (Python)</b>).

                                        Currently, I am learning Javascript, JQuery and the MEAN stack
                                        through an online coding bootcamp called (<b>Free Code Camp</b>). I just completed
                                        a small project creating a website for an artist's paintings

                                        I am working toward becoming a <b>Full Stack Web Developer</b>. I am learning on my
                                        own and loving the challenge. I am learning through an online coding bootcamp called
                                        Free Code Camp. It is teaching me Javascript and the MEAN stack by
                                        doing algorithm challenges and many small projects that you can view through my
                                        <a href="https://gist.github.com/legend911">Github Gist's</a>. It sounds harsh, but
                                        they give you User Stories and just tell you to do it. Learning through building
                                        actual programs has definitely made me a much better programmer.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Once I complete Free Code Camp's first 800 hours of the course and receive my
                                        full stack web developer certificate, I will sign up to do the non-profit projects to 
                                        get more real world experience. I hope that by completing Free Code Camp, I will have
                                        built a great starting point for advancing my career toward Web Development. I am aware 
                                        that this is not a college degree in Computer Science, but experience is important as well.
                                        I will be working on my coding skills daily because that is the best way I have found to
                                        keep and build my skills.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I did state at the beginning of my website that I am working on becoming a web developer. 
                                        However, I am a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer with a lot of experience. I understand the
                                        importance of testing and one of the new things to do is Test Driven Development (TDD). 
                                        I think this is one of the best processes in the Software Development community. To some
                                        it just makes you do more work, but you will become a better programmer by testing a 
                                        majority of your code before you even create it. A little work now saves a lot later. In
                                        light of this, I am going to be learning <b>Automated Testing with Selenium Webdriver</b>. As a 
                                        QA engineer it is only logical that I improve my skills by creating test suites that not only
                                        help QA, but also help the company as whole.
